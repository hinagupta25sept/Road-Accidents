# Road-Accidents
Analysis of Road accidents in India and finding their causes to prevent them
## Road-Accident-Analysis in India
### Problem Statement: “Aim of this project is to analyse the given accident data from a particular region and to obtain inferences regarding the influences and contributions of several attributes to the severity of an accident and hence provide specific measures in order to reduce the rate of these accidents”
A dataset obtained from previously occurring accidents in all the states of India is taken from which inferences are drawn and using  these insights in minimizing the rate of accidents.

## Alarm and Drowsiness Detector
## ALGORITHM
- Setup a camera that monitors a stream for faces.
- If a face is found, we apply facial landmark detection and extract the eye regions
- Now that we have the eye regions, we can compute the eye aspect ratioto determine if the eyes are closed
- If the eye aspect ratio indicates that the eyes have been closed for a sufficiently long enough amount of time, we’ll sound an alarm to wake up the driver.

## TECHNOLOGY USED:
>OpenCV,Python,dlib.
